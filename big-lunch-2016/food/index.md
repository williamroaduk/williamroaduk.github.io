# Hi Neighbours,

When we did the Big Lunch a couple of years ago, we had a huge success in people getting to know one another by sharing food.

We are hoping this year to repeat that. To that end, we are thinking of having some tables specifically allocated for sharing food – also providing a focal point for you to come have a chat or meet new neighbours. 

If you are willing to provide one, or even a few dishes, for sharing that would be wonderful. We're hoping that as well as allowing neighbours to try your lovely cooking, you'll have the opportunity to try some different foods from them as well.

If you have a clear idea of what food you would like to bring along, why not add it to the form below?
If you're wondering what to bring why not look to see where the gaps are?

Remember, if you do bring along a dish, to include a note on any allergens, and to clearly label your dishes so you can find them again,

To add to the form, please add either your name and/or house number, and click the relevant boxes.
We've included some difference categories, which will likely reflect the different tables we setup.
If we come up with any recipe suggestions we'll add them below. If you have any you'd like to suggest, please send an email to: [big-lunch-helpers@williamroad.uk](mailto:[big-lunch-helpers@williamroad.uk).

Thanks!
